## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Node.js developer with a focus on backend work, capable of handling full-stack projects as needed. With over 3 years in corporate settings and an additional 5 years freelancing, I specialize in using Typescript to craft backend solutions across various fields. My strength lies in building and maintaining Node.js applications and understanding the Node.js ecosystem. Although my primary role is backend development, I also excel in creating REST APIs, developing web services, and integrating them with external systems. I'm committed to delivering quality solutions promptly and within budget, leveraging strong organization and a disciplined work ethic.

As for my specific roles and responsibilities, here are some of the key details :

- Design and implement a Node.js backend architecture that meets the specific requirements.
- Utilize latest Node.js frameworks, libraries, and tools to ensure scalability and performance.
- Optimize the code for maximum efficiency and performance.
- Test and debug the backend for reliability and security.
- Deploy the backend and monitor for any issues or performance issues.
- Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the backend.
