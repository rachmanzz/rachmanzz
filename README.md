## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Node.js developer who primarily focuses on backend development but can also handle full-stack projects when necessary. With over 3 years of professional experience in the corporate sector and an additional 5 years of freelancing, I specialize in using Typescript to create backend solutions across various domains. My core expertise lies in building and maintaining Node.js applications, alongside a deep understanding of the Node.js ecosystem and related technologies. While my primary role is backend development, I also have experience in creating and managing REST APIs, developing web services, and integrating them with external systems. My reputation is built on strong organizational skills and a disciplined work ethic, always aiming to deliver high-quality solutions on time and within budget.

As for my specific roles and responsibilities, here are some of the key details :

- Design and implement a Node.js backend architecture that meets the specific requirements.
- Utilize latest Node.js frameworks, libraries, and tools to ensure scalability and performance.
- Optimize the code for maximum efficiency and performance.
- Test and debug the backend for reliability and security.
- Deploy the backend and monitor for any issues or performance issues.
- Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the backend.
